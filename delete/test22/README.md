# Marketing Company Analysis

Our stakeholder is a marketing company looking to target a segment of customers with high incomes (>50_000$/Y). Our task is to develop a model that categorizes individuals into two groups (high income and low income). The stakeholder has provided us with a dataset, and our focus will be exclusively on data from USA customers.
